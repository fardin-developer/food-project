1.      See the file public/js/app.js ,
        here you can see I am posting the data of that btn to server.js

2.      Go to server.js , there will be a route -- app.post('/update-cart',(req,res)=>{}
        Here we are getting all the data of that btn to server

3.       You have to build a logic so that we can console id, name, quantity of that id and total quantity
